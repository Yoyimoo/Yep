 Oh, the joys of cannibalism. So many benefits. <br>
    <p>Sometimes, humans let dumb values stop them from taking biological realities seriously. 
    Take pooping, for example: Most people think pooping is nasty, even though it’s something we do almost every day. 
    Now, some scientists think cannibalism deserves another look.<p>
    <p>Cannibalism naturally occurs in lots of insects, fish, and mammals. 
        And despite our aversion to it as a “civilized” species, cannibalism serves a purpose. 
        A team led by UC San Diego researcher Benjamin Van Allen reviewed research on cannibalism and came to a conclusion that cannibalism could help to limit disease spread in some populations.</p>
